	- ongoing sponsor program
	- a beginner tier prize
	- let's talk about a restructure
		> Current system places too much responsibility on individuals
		> no room for a busy week or whatever (which we all have)
		> let's split to teams
		> Front End (pr, website, surveys, emails, branding, blogs...)
		> Mid-Tier (sponsors, prizes, partnerships...)
		> Back End (MLH, Scheduling, Volunteers, Location, Food)
Thanks Everyone
